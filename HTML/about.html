            <h2>üõ†Ô∏è Project Purpose</h2>
            <p>nCode was built as a school project for my Webpage Workshop class, it's the biggest project yet, that we had over a month to complete, but because I'm a procrastinator, I only started it in the last two weeks.</p>

            <h2>üí° Inspiration</h2>
            <p>The inspiration for the name was of course dCode, but it wasn't the inspiration for the whole project. I wanted to make an encryptor for a long time, I made an HTML special sign converter once, and wanted to expand it to a full blown encryptor, but never got to it until nCode, what also pushed me to work was my friend's big project, it's also an encryptor (although more cybersec based) called <span class="glueCrypt" onclick="toggleVideo()">GlueCrypt.</span></p>

            <h2>üß† What I Learned</h2>
            <h4>Throughout the whole process of making this project, I've learnt many things, mainly related to CSS, and here are some of them:</h4>
            <h6><i class="fa-solid fa-map-location-dot"></i> Positioning</h6>
            <p>While building this project I've become way more proficient with scaling, positioning, and moving items on a webpage.</p>
            <h6>‚ñ£ CSS Layouts</h6>
            <p>I've learned how to use flexbox and grid to create responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.</p>
            <h6><i class="fa-solid fa-desktop"></i> Responsive Design</h6>
            <p>I've learned how to make a webpage responsive, so it looks good on both mobile and desktop devices.</p>
            <h6><i class="fa-solid fa-braille"></i> Project division</h6>
            <p>I've learned how to divide a project into smaller parts, so I can work on them separately and then combine them into one big project.</p>
